# Browser Riddles

## Motivation

```
I wish i could have/found a fun way to solve some riddles and learn/explore some core knowledge of the web when i started my frontend software engineer journey.
```

```
Just recently I am playing around with VueJS and some puzzle solving game/board game a little bit , so i decide to bring this project live with Vue for folks who want to take some challenges for your browser skill.
